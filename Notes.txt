 ~ CORS Error : Happens when you are making a request from x domain to y domain
                Browser Throws this error , it is bothered about the cors error
                We have to add cors in backend to allow requests from frontend or specific URLs based on some conditions
                we have to do with credentials true in both front end and backend to let our cookies be passed 


// EC2 
    Create an instance by generating a pem file (thats like a secret key , should be kept safe)                

    connect to instancef  with ssh ( terminal )
    follow the stepe mentioned
    Then do (ssh -i "Connect_App.pem" ubuntu@ec8p-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com) to connect to your machine (this will be present in AWS)
    Then Install everything needed ot run the project on AWS e.g node (version should be same)
    the Do git clone the repo from github 
    LS on aws instance to see the cloned cloned 
    Create the build for the project to deploy it on the AWS
    Do npm i also here
    Now we have to run the dist on the server which contains all the code that we need
    Install Nginx
    Use it to host our front end project 
    Do sudo apt update (to update system dependences)
    Then do sudo apt install nginx
    Then Do sudo systemctl start nginx ( to start the nginx)
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    Copy all the code from dist to the nginx server now located at /var/www/html/
    sudo scp -r dist/* /var/www/html/ 
    Do port mapping , enable port 80 on which your  nginx is running
    Go to security groups and inbound rules and set the port    
    Then go to IP and hit it to see the front end code running

   // EC2 Deployment backend
     Do Npm start over machine
     Allow network access to your ip in mongo DB (Allow IP Address) 
     Here Also we need to do port mapping like we did in front end
     Now it will say cannot get /
     We cannot keep our system open and do npm run forever , we need something to do that for us 
     This can be done by pm2 package   npm i pm2 -g
     then start our script via pm2 like pm2 start npm -- start
     pm2 logs to see the logs if face any issue
     pm2 flush npm to clear the process running
     pm2 list to see all the processes started
     pm2 stop npm to stop the process
     pm2 delete npm to delete the process

     Our front end is running on localhost and now we have to match the BE and fE 

     Front End : http://13.127.72.158/
     Back End : http://13.127.72.158:3000

     Domain Mapping : http://connect.com/
                      http://connect.com:3000 But we want the pattern to be http://connect.com/api

                      For this we need to map :3000 to /api
                      We need nginx proxy pass to do that

                      sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
                      
                                server_name 13.127.72.158;
                                location /api/ {
                                    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
                                    proxy_http_version 1.1;
                                    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                                    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                                    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
                                }

                        Restart Nginx sudo systemctl restart nginx
