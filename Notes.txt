 ~ CORS Error : Happens when you are making a request from x domain to y domain
                Browser Throws this error , it is bothered about the cors error
                We have to add cors in backend to allow requests from frontend or specific URLs based on some conditions
                we have to do with credentials true in both front end and backend to let our cookies be passed
